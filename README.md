## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Andrew WELLS

_Student NetID_: aw34

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Grading}
- Assumptions:
  - This is something that I actually do, so my assumptions will be the set of true propositions for COMP 382.
- Assets:
  - Approximately thirty undergrads and grad students with a passion for justice and a nose for illicit cooperation.
  - Approximately 8 hrs per week per TA (so 240 man hours per week).
- Threats:
  - Unscrupulous undergrads that want to pass a required class.
  - Inquisitive undergrads who want to see what they can get away with?
  - Inconsistent grading caused by subjective factors.
  - An obligation to respond to all emails complaining about the class.
- Countermeasures:
  - Rather than assigning **n** assignments to each TA, give each TA **k x n** instances of problems to grade. Thus the grading is as consistent as possible across assignments (no assignment is entirely graded by one TA). This can be done easily with a software package.
  - Randomly shuffle pairings of TA's and student's. (I.e., don't use alphabetical.) This could be handled by the same software package.
  - Have the TA's grade in random order to avoid subjective bias. (e.g., the first assignment may be graded more harshly on average.) The software package could present assignments in a random order.
  - Have the student's identity hidden from the TA's. The software package can hide the student's names. Other identifying information would be difficult to detect/remove.
  - Use a tool such as MOSS to detect plagiarism in code. This can be automated fairly easily for each assignment.
  - Have some limit to students' regrade requests to prevent incessant emailing. This is hard to do in a fair, one-size-fits-all manner. Maybe have some possible penalty for regrading (e.g., can lose points or gain them) to discourage it.
  - Attempt to characterize problems into some small number of classes. Then have TA's communicate to attempt consistent grading and detect plagiarism. This is very hard to do in a robust way. Grades will probably have a fair amount of randomness due to subjective factors. Having enough assignments throughout the semester will hopefully cause the information to outweigh the noise.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - With D1 schools spending up to 50 million dollars on their football teams in a given year, it seems evident that some people care about these teams a lot. The ultimate goal of each team is presumably to win the national championship game. We will assume that attempts to do this will not utilize resources on the nation-state level (e.g., satellites will not be used to spy on opposing teams' practices). We will not assume morality (i.e., we will assume that there is at least a small group of people that are happy to cheat to help a given team win.), but we will assume that there is no one willing to risk life in prison to hurt a given team (e.g., no assassination attempts).
- Assets:
  - A small portion of the 50 million dollar budget. Let's say 5 million.
  - A large staff, say 97 people not counting the players.
- Threats:
  - Disqualification. Anything from academic probation to performance enhancing drug use can disqualify a player.
